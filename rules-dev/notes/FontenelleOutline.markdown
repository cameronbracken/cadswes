## Fontenelle operational rules outline 
### Rule 1 - Set Baseflows
	- Check month 
	- Drop to baseflow value in September
	- If readjustment value exists then change baseflow in fall
	- Should the redjustment be done automatically by the model?
	- Check Min 
### Rule 2 - Spring Releases
	- Check Month 
	- Set flow to 1700 cfs April 1
		- Check if 100cfs/day is violated
	- June set release to meet 6500ft target by July 1
	- July 1 set back to 1700 cfs 

- General structure could be by month as well since operations can be defined along thes boundaries
