More Information and Advice:

%  SECTION HEADS

 ---------------
 Level 1 head

 Use the \section{} command to identify level 1 heads;
 type the appropriate head wording between the curly
 brackets, as shown below.

 Capitalize the first letter of each word (expect for
 prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
 three or fewer letters).

 Do not hyphenate level 1 heads. To break lines,
 type \protect\\ where you want the break to occur.
 AGU prefers the inverted triangle, breaking before
 prepositions, conjunctions, and articles, if possible.

An example:
\section{Level 1 Head: Introduction}

 ---------------
 Level 2 head

 Use the \subsection{} command to identify level 2 heads.

 Capitalize the first letter of each word (expect for
 prepositions, conjunctions, and articles that are
 three or fewer letters).

 Do not hyphenate level 1 heads. To break lines,
 type \protect\\ where you want the break to occur.
 AGU prefers the inverted triangle, breaking before
 prepositions, conjunctions, and articles, if possible.

\subsection{Level 2 Head} An example.

 ---------------
 Level 3 head

 Use the \subsubsection{} command to identify level 3 heads

 Capitalize only the first letter of the first word, acronyms,
 first letter of proper nouns, and first letter of first word
 after a colon.

 Hyphenation is permitted in level 3 heads, if needed.

\subsubsection{Level 3 Head} An example.

\subsubsubsection{Level 4 Head} An example.

%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.

 Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered e.g.:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered e.g.:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES
% OF SINGLE COLUMN WIDTH (20 pc, 8.3 cm)
% using double backslashes (\\).

% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

% There is another multiline equation environment:
% \begin{aguleftmath}...\end{aguleftmath}
% The equation is aligned left and the second line indents to
% the width of a paragraph indent (AGU style)

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%
% To reset the equation counter, place the setcounter{equation}
% command in front of your equation(s).
%\setcounter{equation}{0}

% Set the equation counter to 0 if the next
% number needed is 1 or set it to 7 if the
% next number needed is 8, etc.
%
% The \setcounter{equation} command does affect
% equations appearing later in the manuscript.

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
