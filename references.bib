title = {River flow fluctuation analysis: Effect of watershed area},
abstract = {This study presents the results of a detailed river flow fluctuation analysis on daily records from 14 stations in the Flint River Basin in Georgia in the southeastern United States with special focus on the effect of watershed area on long memory of river flow fluctuations. The areas of the watersheds draining to the stations range from 23 to 19,606 km2. The climatic and seasonal trends are removed using the detrended fluctuation analysis technique. Results show that (1) river flow fluctuations have two distinct scaling regimes, and the scaling break is delayed for large watershed areas; (2) large watersheds have more persistent river flow fluctuations and stronger long memory (i.e., for lag times beyond the scale break) than small watersheds do; (3) the long memory of river flow fluctuations does not come from the long memory of precipitation; (4) a linear reservoir unit hydrograph transfer function approach does not capture correctly the basin processes that convert short-memory precipitation to long-memory streamflow; and (5) the degree of multifractality of river flow fluctuations decreases with increasing watershed area. The results clearly indicate that watershed area is an important factor in the long-memory studies of streamflow such as streamflow prediction.},

abstract = {We identify a previously undetected link between the river network morphology and key recession curves properties through a conceptual-physical model of the drainage process of the riparian unconfined aquifer. We show that the power-law exponent, α, of −dQ/dt vs. Q curves is related to the power-law exponent of N(l) vs. G(l) curves (which we show to be connected to Hack's law), where l is the downstream distance from the channel heads, N(l) is the number of channel reaches exactly located at a distance l from their channel head, and G(l) is the total length of the network located at a distance greater or equal to l from channel heads. Using Digital Terrain Models and daily discharge observations from 67 US basins we find that geomorphologic α estimates match well the values obtained from recession curves analyses. Finally, we argue that the link between recession flows and network morphology points to an important role of low-flow discharges in shaping the channel network.},

The approach described has been developed to facilitate integrated assessment research in support of regional resource management. Global climate model scenarios are evaluated and selected based on historic 20th century simulations. A statistical downscaling method is then applied to produce a regional data set. To facilitate the use of climate projections in hydrologic assessment, additional statistical mapping may be applied to generate synthetic station time series. Finally, results are presented from a regional climate model that indicate important differences in the regional climate response from what is captured by global models and statistical downscaling.},

title = {Drought probabilities and return period for annual streamflows series},
abstract = {Probabilistic characterization of drought events is extremely important in water resources planning and management. In spite of the large number of studies that have been carried on the subject, the exact derivation of the probabilistic structure of drought characteristics is still an open problem, especially when both duration and accumulated deficit (or intensity) are taken into account. This study focuses on the derivation of the probability distribution of drought episodes considering both drought duration and accumulated deficit (or intensity) as well as of the ensuing return period, when the underlying hydrological variable is autocorrelated. First, the marginal distribution of drought length is investigated, showing that the simple Markov chain, usually adopted to model the sequence of deficits and surpluses, is not adequate when the underlying series exhibits a significant autocorrelation. Following previous studies, a Dis-crete Autoregressive Moving Average (DARMA) model is proposed to better model drought length. Then,the derivation of the moments of accumulated deficit conditioned on a fixed drought length is pursued. It is shown that the deficit series that is obtained by clipping an autocorrelated stationary series with a constant threshold is not i.i.d., and therefore not stationary. Thus, a fully multivariate approach, based on a truncated multivariate normal model, is applied to derive the moments of accumulated deficit as a function of the distribution of the underlying variable and of the threshold. In order to overcome numerical difficulties related to the integration of the multivariate distributions, empirical approximations are also proposed. Such moments are then used to derive approximate expressions of the bivariate distributions of accumulated deficit (or intensity) and length, based on the assumption that the distribution of accumulated deficit conditioned on a fixed length is beta, and expressions to compute the return period of drought events. The proposed procedure is illustrated by applying it to four streamflow data characterized by different levels of autocorrelation and skewness.},

abstract = {Water managers throughout the Western U.S. depend on seasonal forecasts to assist with operations and planning. In this study, we develop a seasonal forecasting model to aid water resources decision-making in the Truckee-Carson River System. We analyze large-scale climate information that has a direct impact on our basin of interest to develop predictors to spring runoff. The predictors are snow water equivalent (SWE) and 500mb geopotential height and sea surface temperature (SST) ``indices'' developed in this study. We use local regression methods to provide ensemble (probabilistic) forecasts. Results show that the incorporation of climate information, particularly the 500mb geopotential height index, improves the skills of forecasts at longer lead times when compared with forecasts based on snowpack information alone. The technique is general and could be used to incorporate large- scale climate information into ensemble streamflow forecasts for other river basins.},

title = {A nonparametric stochastic approach for multisite disaggregation of annual to daily streamflow},
abstract = {Streamflow disaggregation techniques are used to distribute a single aggregate flow value to multiple sites in both space and time while preserving distributional statistics (i.e., mean, variance, skewness, and maximum and minimum values) from observed data. A number of techniques exist for accomplishing this task through a variety of parametric and nonparametric approaches. However, most of these methods do not perform well for disaggregation to daily time scales. This is generally due to a mismatch between the parametric distributions appropriate for daily flows versus monthly or annual flows, the high dimension of the disaggregation problem, compounded uncertainty in parameter estimation for multistage approaches, and the inability to maintain flow continuity across disaggregation time period boundaries. We present a method that directly simulates daily data at multiple locations from a single annual flow value via K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) resampling of daily flow proportion vectors. The procedure is simple and data driven and captures observed statistics quite well. Furthermore, the generated daily data are continuous and display lag correlation structure consistent with that of the observed data. The utility and effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated for selected sites in the San Juan River Basin, located in southwestern Colorado, and later compared with the disaggregation technique of Prairie et al. (2007) for several locations in the Colorado River Basin.},

title = {Conditional resampling of hydrologic time series using multiple predictor variables: A K-nearest neighbour approach},
abstract = {Unlike parametric alternatives for time series generation, non-parametric approaches generate new values by conditionally resampling past observations using a probability rationale. Observations lying "close" to the conditioning vector are resampled with higher probability, "closeness" is defined using a Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance formulation. A common problem with these approaches is the difficulty in distinguishing the importance of each predictor in the estimation of the distance. As a consequence, the conditional probability and hence the resampled series, can offer a biased representation of the true population it aims to sim- ulate. This paper presents a variation of the K-nearest neighbour resampler designed for use with multiple predictor variables. In the modification proposed, an influence weight is assigned to each predictor in the conditioning set with the aim of identifying nearest neighbours that represent the conditional dependence in an improved manner. The workability of the proposed modification is tested using synthetic data from known linear and non-linear models and its applicability is illustrated through an example where daily rainfall is downscaled over 15 stations near Sydney, Australia using a predictor set consisting of selected large-scale atmo- spheric circulation variables.},

title = {A stochastic nonparametric technique for space-time disaggregation of streamflows},
abstract = {Stochastic disaggregation models are used to simulate streamflows at multiple sites preserving their temporal and spatial dependencies. Traditional approaches to this problem involve transforming the streamflow data of each month and at every location to a Gaussian structure and subsequently fitting a linear model in the transformed space. The simulations are then back transformed to the original space. The main drawbacks of this approach are (1) transforming marginals to Gaussian need not lead to the correct multivariate distribution particularly if the dependence across variables is nonlinear, and (2) the number of parameters to be estimated for a traditional disaggregation model grows rapidly with an increase in space or time components. We present a K-nearest-neighbor approach to resample monthly flows conditioned on an annual value in a temporal disaggregation or multiple upstream locations conditioned on a downstream location for a spatial disaggregation. The method is parsimonious, as the only parameter to estimate is K (the number of nearest neighbors to be used in resampling). Simulating space-time flow scenarios conditioned upon large-scale climate information (e.g., El Nin ̃o--Southern Oscillation, etc.) can be easily achieved. We demonstrate the utility of this methodology by applying it for space-time disaggregation of streamflows in the Upper Colorado River basin. The method appropriately captures the distributional and spatial dependency properties at all the locations.},

title = {Complex seasonal cycle of ecohydrology in the Southwest United States},
abstract = {This study investigates the causes for, and distribution of, unimodal versus bimodal seasonal cycle of vegetation greenness in the Southwest United States using extensive site observations, climate data, satellite data, and the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) vegetation model. Peak vegetation greenness is achieved in a clockwise manner across the Southwest, beginning in spring in the Sonoran Desert following winter rains, then in Utah-Colorado with snowmelt/summer rains, and finally in New Mexico--eastern Arizona with late summer monsoon rains. At high elevations, spring-summer snowmelt is critical for supplying the necessary soil moisture to trigger vegetation growth. A bimodal seasonal cycle of vegetation greenness is evident in satellite data and LPJ simulations across eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, characterized by peaks during late spring--early summer and late summer--early autumn. This bimodal green-up remains a pressing paradox for which many competing hypotheses exist. The mechanism for this seasonal pattern is demonstrated using LPJ and observational data and is found to deviate from the traditional pulse-reserve paradigm. This paradigm states that rainfall events in arid lands produce nearly immediate pulses of vegetation growth and accumulation of reserves but does not consider cold dormancy, time-lagged vegetation responses, or rainfall seasonality. The following soil moisture based mechanism for bimodal greening is proposed. The initial peak in vegetation greenness during late spring--early summer results from a break in cold dormancy and benefits from the gradual winter-long accumulation of deep soil moisture from weak synoptic rain events and snowmelt in colder regions. Limited precipitation and ongoing transpiration, from the initial vegetation greening, trigger a midsummer drying of the soil and a consequential minimum in vegetation activity. Later, pulses of monsoon rainfall in late summer--early autumn support the secondary greening, although significant runoff of brief, intense rainstorms and substantial soil evaporation limit moisture to the upper soil layers.},

title = {A nonparametric approach for representing interannual dependence in monthly streamflow sequences},
abstract = {The estimation of risks associated with water management plans requires generation of synthetic streamflow sequences. The mathematical algorithms used to generate these sequences at monthly timescales are found lacking in two main respects: inability in preserving dependence attributes particularly at large (seasonal to interannual) time lags and a poor representation of observed distributional characteristics, in particular, representation of strong asymmetry or multimodality in the probability density function. Proposed here is an alternative that naturally incorporates both observed dependence and distributional attributes in the generated sequences. Use of a nonparametric framework provides an effective means for representing the observed probability distribution, while the use of a ``variable kernel'' ensures accurate modeling of streamflow data sets that contain a substantial number of zero-flow values. A careful selection of prior flows imparts the appropriate short-term memory, while use of an ``aggregate'' flow variable allows representation of interannual dependence. The nonparametric simulation model is applied to monthly flows from the Beaver River near Beaver, Utah, and the Burrendong dam inflows, New South Wales, Australia.},

title = {A nonparametric approach for paleohydrologic reconstruction of annual streamflow ensembles},
abstract = {As multicentury records of natural hydrologic variability, tree ring reconstructions of streamflow have proven valuable in water resources planning and management. All previous reconstructions have used parametric methods, most often regression, to develop a model relating a set of tree ring data to a target hydrology. In this paper, we present the first development and application of a K nearest neighbor (KNN) nonparametric method to reconstruct naturalized annual streamflow ensembles from tree ring chronology data in the Upper Colorado River Basin region. The method is developed using tree ring chronologies from the period 1400--2005 and naturalized streamflow from the period 1906--2005 at the important Lees Ferry, Arizona, gauge on the Colorado River to develop annual streamflow ensembles for this gauge for the 1400-- 1905 period. The proposed KNN algorithm was developed and tested using cross validation for the overlap period, i.e., the contemporary observed period for which both the tree ring and streamflow data are available (1906--2005). The cross-validated streamflow reconstructions for the selected contemporary period compare very well with the observed flows and also with published parametric streamflow reconstructions for this gauge. The proposed nonparametric method provides an ensemble of streamflows for each year in the paleohydrologic reconstruction period (1400--1905) and, consequently, a more realistic asymmetric confidence interval than one obtained through most parametric approaches. Also, the K nearest neighbors are obtained only from the tree ring chronology data, and thus, the method can be used to reconstruct structured and even nonnumerical data for use in water resources modeling.},

This abnormal condition is evidently aided by frequent occurrences of El Ni{\~n}o Modoki events and associated wind convergence to the dateline during 2000--2004. The sea level rise in central Pacific succeeded a phase of lower than normal sea level associated with La Ni{\~n}a Modoki events toward the end of 20th century. A correlation analysis confirms the dominant influence of El Ni{\~n}o/La Ni{\~n}a Modoki on the sea level rise in the central Pacific as compared to that of the El Ni{\~n}o/La Ni{\~n}a. This influence can even be seen in remote regions such as the coasts of California and Mauritius through atmospheric teleconnections.},

title = {A semiparametric multivariate and multisite weather generator},
abstract = {We propose a semiparametric multivariate weather generator with greater ability to reproduce the historical statistics, especially the wet and dry spells. The proposed approach has two steps: (1) a Markov Chain for generating the precipitation state (i.e., no rain, rain, or heavy rain), and (2) a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) bootstrap resampler for generating the multivariate weather variables. The Markov Chain captures the spell statistics while the k-NN bootstrap captures the distributional and lag-dependence statistics of the weather variables. Traditional k-NN generators tend to under-simulate the wet and dry spells that are keys to watershed and agricultural modeling for water planning and management; hence the motivation for this research. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach and its improvement over the traditional k-NN approach through an application to daily weather data from Pergamino in the Pampas region of Argentina. We show the applicability of the proposed framework in simulating weather scenarios conditional on the seasonal climate forecast and also at multiple sites in the Pampas region.},

title = {A stochastic nonparametric approach for streamflow generation combining observational and paleoreconstructed data},
abstract = {The Colorado River basin experienced the worst drought on record during 2000-- 2004. Paleoreconstructions of streamflow for the preobservational period show droughts of greater magnitude and duration, indicating that the recent drought is not unusual. The rich information provided by paleoreconstructions should be incorporated in stochastic streamflow models, enabling the generation of realistic flow scenarios required for robust water resources planning and management. However, the magnitudes of reconstructed streamflow have a high degree of uncertainty. This apparent weakness of the paleodata has made their use in water resources planning contentious, despite their availability for many decades. However, few contest the accuracy of hydrologic state (i.e., dry and wet periods). A key question is how to combine the long paleoreconstructed streamflow information of lower reliability with the shorter observational data to develop a framework for streamflow simulation. We propose a unique stochastic streamflow simulation framework combining these two data sets. This has two components: (1) a nonhomogeneous Markov chain model, developed using the paleodata, which is used to simulate the hydrologic state, and (2) a nonparametric K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) time series bootstrap of observational flow magnitudes conditioned on the hydrologic state, thus combining the respective strengths of the two data sets. The framework is demonstrated for the Lees Ferry, Arizona, stream gauge on the Colorado River. The simulations show the ability to reproduce relevant statistics of the observational period and generate a rich variety of wet and dry sequences for use in sustainable management of water resources.},

A review of several standard references on surface-water-quality modeling indicates that the analytical solution to the constant-parameter advection- dispersion equation for this type of boundary condition has been generally overlooked. Here an exact analytical solution that considers a continuous load of finite duration is compared to an approximate analytical solution presented elsewhere. Results indicate that the exact analytical solution should be used for verification of nu- merical solutions and other solute-transport problems wherein a high level of accuracy is required.},

title = {Stochastic recession rates and the probabilistic structure of stream flows},
abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of interevent variability of streamflow recession rates on two key streamflow statistics, namely, the equilibrium probability density function (pdf) and the autocorrelation. The relevance of the problem lies in the need to quantify and predict streamflow availability, on the basis of measurable rainfall and landscape attributes, by explicitly incorporating the stochasticity of the underlying climate and transport processes. Novel expressions for the seasonal pdf and the autocorrelation of the daily streamflows are derived by incorporating the randomness of the recession rates into a probabilistic framework where the streamflow fluctuations are explicitly related to the intermittency of the rainfall forcing. The presence of stochastic recession time constants is shown to impact only the third- and higher-order moments of the probability density function of the daily streamflows, without altering the mean and the variance of the pdf. A remarkable effect is instead produced on the correlation structure, which may exhibit long-term persistence even in the presence of a weak randomness of the recession rate. A relevant case study is then discussed to show that incorporating the stochasticity of the recession time constant leads to an improvement of the model ability to capture the behavior of the equilibrium streamflow pdf and of the underlying correlation function.},

This analysis yields a lower-bound estimate of the uncertainties, and a consistent global view of the error characteristics and their regional and seasonal variations, and reveals many undocumented error features over areas with no validation data available. The uncertainties are relatively small (40--60%) over the oceans, especially in the tropics, and over southern South America. There are large uncertainties (100--140%) over high latitudes (poleward of 40$\,^{\circ}$ latitude), especially during the cold season. High relative uncertainties are also evident through the seasons over complex terrain areas, including the Tibetan Plateau, the Rockies and the Andes. Coastlines and water bodies also indicate high measurement uncertainty. The estimated global uncertainties also exhibit systematic seasonal, regional as well as rain-rate dependencies, with lowest uncertainties over tropical oceanic regions with strong, convective precipitation, and highest ones over wintery, complex land surfaces with light precipitation.},

title = {RiverWare decision support tool for planning sustainable river development with hydropower},
abstract = {Fresh water supplies, energy and environmental preservation are three of the most pressing issues facing humanity. Planning for development of reservoir and hydropower on the rivers of the world can be improved by the use of powerful tools to analyze the natural hydrologic supply of water and determine the most effective management that balances human and ecosystem needs. Simulation and optimization modeling tools must be flexible to analyze structural and mult-objective operational alternatives under the varying and changing hydrology. Hydropower operations should additionally consider potential variations and trends in the value of energy. Environmental effects including water quality and riparian habitats are also operating objectives. Results of planning studies include risk-based predictions of the benefits and effects of a proposed project. Trade-off and sensitivity analysis provide additional input to the decision-making process. The University of Colorado Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems develops tools for planning studies with these capabilities. The RiverWare suite of tools includes: 1) generation of synthetic hydrologic sequences that capture natural variability and trends due to climate change; 2) long-lead forecasting capabilities based on climate signals; 3) mulit-objective river and reservoir modeling tools including hydropower with value of energy; and 4) statistical analysis tools for representation of the outcomes of the analysis. These tools are used by major water management agencies in the US such as Bureau of Reclamation, Corps of Engineers and Tennessee Valley Authority, and also numerous smaller water management agencies. This paper and presentation describe these tools and two application by AMEC Earth and Environmental for the El Dorado Irrigation District in California, and the Tarrent County Regional Water District in Ft. Worth, Texas.},

abstract = {Recognizing that the frequency distribution of annual maximum floods at a given location may change over time in response to interannual and longer climate fluctuations, we compare two approaches for the estimation of flood quantiles conditional on selected ``climate indices'' that carry the signal of structured low-frequency climate variation, and influence the atmospheric mechanisms that modify local precipitation and flood potential. A parametric quantile regression approach and a semiparametric local likelihood approach are compared using synthetic data sets and for data from a streamflow gauging station in the western United States. Their relative utility in different settings for seasonal flood risk forecasting as well as for the assessment of long-term variation in flood potential is discussed.},

title = {Modified K-NN model for stochastic streamflow simulation},
abstract = {This paper presents a lag-1 modified K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach for stochastic streamflow simulation. The simula- tion at any time t given the value at the time t−1 involves two steps: (1) obtaining the conditional mean from a local polynomial fitted to the historical values of time t and t−1, and (2) then resampling (i.e., bootstrapping) a residual at one of the historical observations and adding it to the conditional mean. The residuals are resampled using a probability metric that gives more weight to the nearest neighbor and less to the farthest. The ``residual resampling'' step is the modification to the traditional K-NN time-series bootstrap approach, which enables the generation of values not seen in the historical record. This model is applied to monthly streamflow at the Lees Ferry stream gauge on the Colorado River and is compared to both a parametric periodic autoregressive and a nonparametric index sequential method for streamflow generation, each widely used in practice. The modified K-NN approach is found to exhibit better performance in terms of capturing the features present in the data.},

A vector of weather variables (solar radiation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average dew point temperature, average wind speed, and precipitation) on a day of interest is resampled from the historical data by conditioning on the vector of the same variables (feature vector) on the preceding day. The resampling is done from the k nearest neighbors in state space of the feature vector using a weight function. This approach is equivalent to a nonparametric approximation of a multivariate, lag 1 Markov process. It does not require prior assumptions as to the form of the joint probability density function of the variables. An application of the resampling scheme with 30 years of daily weather data at Salt Lake City, Utah, is provided. Results are compared with those from the application of a multivariate autoregressive model similar to that of Richardson [1981].},

title = {Hydroclimatology of the 2008 Midwest floods},
abstract = {The late spring/early summer flooding that occurred in the American Midwest between May and June 2008 resulted from a combination of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that supported a steady influx of moisture into the area. A low pressure system centered over the central-western United States steered a strong jet and associated storms along its eastern edge from the west to southwest and an anomalously strong Great Plains Low Level Jet brought continuous warm and moist air into the area from the Gulf of Mexico into the area. We examine and quantify here the impact these circulation patterns had on the hydroclimatology of the Midwest highlighting the magnitude, frequency, geographic distribution, and temporal evolution of precipitation that ultimately magnified the flooding. Historical precipitation records were used to assess the regional rainfall characteristics at various geographic and time scales. Five distinct hydroclimatic characteristics contributed to the definition of the 2008 flood including persistent high surface soil moisture conditions prior to flooding exasperated by anomalously high rainfall, extreme rainfall totals covering extensive areas, increased frequency of shorter-term, smaller-magnitude events, persistent multiday heavy precipitation events, and extreme flood-producing rain storms. The major flooding lasted for approximately 24 days and most greatly impacted the state of Iowa, southern Wisconsin, and central Indiana. Its occurrence during the May--June period makes the event especially unusual for this region.},

title = {Interferential Impact of ENSO and PDO on Dry and Wet Conditions in the U. S. Great Plains},
abstract = {The influence of the El Nin ̃o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) interference on the dry and wet conditions in the Great Plains of the United States (US) has been examined using monthly observational datasets. It is shown that both ENSO and PDO can generate a similar pattern of atmospheric and oceanic anomalies over the eastern part of the North Pacific and western North America that has significant impact on the climate over the Great Plains. Furthermore, the relationship between ENSO/PDO and climate anomalies in the Great Plains is intensified when ENSO and PDO are in phase (El Nin ̃o and warm PDO, or La Nin ̃a and cold PDO). On average, anomalies over the Great Plains favor wet (dry) conditions when both ENSO and PDO are in the positive (negative) phase. However, when ENSO and PDO are out of phase, the relationship is weakened and the anomalies over the Great Plains tend toward neutral. Without ENSO, PDO alone does not affect the North American climate significantly. The relationship is quite robust for different seasons with strongest effects for the months of spring, weakest effects for the months of autumn, while the months of winter and summer fall in-between. The seasonality of the relationship may be associated with the seasonal dependence of the anomalies of general circulation and the pattern of mean seasonal cycle in the North Pacific.The contrasting impact of the interference of ENSO and PDO on the climate anomalies in the Great Plains is associated with differences in the ocean-atmosphere anomalies. When ENSO and PDO are in phase, the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies extend from the equatorial Pacific to the higher latitudes of the North Pacific via the eastern ocean. The distribution of the corresponding anomalies of sea level pressure (SLP) and the wind at 1000 hPa forms an ellipse with a southeast-northwest orientation of the long axis because the SST anomalies promote coherent changes in SLP in the central North Pacific. In the upper troposphere, a similar teleconnection pattern with the same sign generated by ENSO and PDO is overlapped and enhanced, which favors anomaly (dry and wet) condition in the Great Plains. However, when ENSO and PDO are out of phase, the SST anomalies have the same sign in the tropical and central North Pacific, which is opposite to the anomalies near the west coast of North America. The anomalously cyclonic circulation over the North Pacific is weaker in the out-of-phase situation than in the in-phase situation. The distribution of the anomalies of SLP and the wind at 1000 hPa resembles a circle. Meanwhile, in the upper troposphere, ENSO and PDO generate a similar teleconnection pattern with opposite sign, causing cancellation of the anomalous circulation and favoring neutral climate in the Great Plains.},

title = {Simulating Ensembles of Source Water Quality Using a K-Nearest Neighbor Resampling Approach},
abstract = {Climatological, geological, and water management factors can cause significant variability in surface water quality. As drinking water quality standards become more stringent, the ability to quantify the variability of source water quality becomes more important for decision-making and planning in water treatment for regulatory compliance. However, paucity of long- term water quality data makes it challenging to apply traditional simulation techniques. To overcome this limitation, we have developed and applied a robust nonparametric K-nearest neighbor (K-nn) bootstrap approach utilizing the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Information Collection Rule (ICR) data. In this technique, first an appropriate ``feature vector'' is formed from the best available explanatory variables. The nearest neighbors to the feature vector are identified from the ICR data and are resampled using a weight function. Repetition of this results in water quality ensembles, and consequently the distribution and the quantification of the variability. The main strengths of the approach are its flexibility, simplicity, and the ability to use a large amount of spatialdata with limited temporal extent to provide water quality ensembles for any given location. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to simulate monthly ensembles of total organic carbon for two utilities in the U.S. with very different watersheds and to alkalinity and bromide at two other U.S. utilities.},

title = {A physically based, variable contributing area model of basin hydrology},
abstract = {A hydrological forecasting model is presented that attempts to combine the important distributed effects of channel network topology and dynamic contributing areas with the advantages of simple lumped parameter basin models. Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/con- tributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from the Crimple Beck basin are described. Using only measured and estimated parameter values, with- out optimization, the model makes satisfactory predictions of basin response. The modular form of the model structure should allow application over a range of small and medium sized basins while retaining the possibility of including more complex model components when suitable data are available.},

title = {Quantifying streamflow change caused by forest disturbance at a large spatial scale: A single watershed study},
abstract = {Climatic variability and forest disturbance are commonly recognized as two major drivers influencing streamflow change in large-scale forested watersheds. The greatest challenge in evaluating quantitative hydrological effects of forest disturbance is the removal of climatic effect on hydrology. In this paper, a method was designed to quantify respective contributions of large-scale forest disturbance and climatic variability on streamflow using the Willow River watershed (2860 km2) located in the central part of British Columbia, Canada. Long-term (>50 years) data on hydrology, climate, and timber harvesting history represented by equivalent clear-cutting area (ECA) were available to discern climatic and forestry influences on streamflow by three steps. First, effective precipitation, an integrated climatic index, was generated by subtracting evapotranspiration from precipitation. Second, modified double mass curves were developed by plotting accumulated annual streamflow against annual effective precipitation, which presented a much clearer picture of the cumulative effects of forest disturbance on streamflow following removal of climatic influence. The average annual streamflow changes that were attributed to forest disturbances and climatic variability were then estimated to be +58.7 and −72.4 mm, respectively. The positive (increasing) and negative (decreasing) values in streamflow change indicated opposite change directions, which suggest an offsetting effect between forest disturbance and climatic variability in the study watershed. Finally, a multivariate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was generated to establish quantitative relationships between accumulated annual streamflow deviation attributed to forest disturbances and annual ECA. The model was then used to project streamflow change under various timber harvesting scenarios. The methodology can be effectively applied to any large-scale single watershed where long-term data (>50 years) are available.},

abstract = {Statistical downscaling provides a technique to derive local scale information of precipitation and temperature from numerical weather prediction model output. The K- nearest neighbor (K-nn) is a new analog-type approach that is used in this paper to downscale the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) 1998 medium range forecast (MRF) model output. The K-nn algorithm queries days similar to a given feature vector in this archive, and using EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) analysis identifies a subset of days (K) similar to the feature day. These K days are then weighted using a bi-square weight function, and randomly sampled to generate ensembles. A set of 15 MRF runs was used, and 7 ensemble members were generated from each run. The ensemble of 105 members was then used to select the local scale precipitation and temperature values in four diverse basins across the contiguous US. These downscaled precipitation and temperature estimates were subsequently analyzed to test the performance of this downscaling approach.The downscaled ensembles were evaluated in terms of bias, the ranked probability skill score as a measure of forecast skill, spatial co-variability between stations, temporal persistence, the consistency between variables, conditional bias, and to develop spread- skill relationships. Though this approach does not explicitly model the space-time variability of the weather fields at each individual stations, the above statistics were extremely well captured. The K-nn method was also compared with a multiple linear regression based downscaling model.},
