\section{Past Work}
\subsection{REU Project}
\begin{frame}{Past Work - REU Project}
\pause
The goal of the project was to: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop a \alert{seasonal streamflow forecast framework}
\begin{itemize}

\item Handle many spatial locations 
\item Preserve spatial and temporal dependencies
\item Incorporate large scale climate predictors
\item Use modern nonparametric methods
\item Generate multi-model ensembles
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Results are a ``proof-of-concept.''
\item Forecast skill is retained after disag.
\item A relatively simple, robust framework that compares well to existing models.
