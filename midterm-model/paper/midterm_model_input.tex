\section{Introduction}

Every month the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) provides an outlook of reservoir operations in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) for the following 24 months (\url{http://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/crsp/studies/}).  The outlooks are produced with a RiverWare model known as the 24-Month study (24MS).  The inputs to the 24MS are unregulated reservoir inflows and outflows, starting elevations and storages. The outputs are reservoir storages and elevations for the next 24 months (in some cases the model is run for up to 32 months).  The model takes unregulated flow input since it has very few explicit demands. Unregulated inflow forcasts are generated by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC). Outflow forecasts are generated colaboratively by reservor operators in both the lower and upper CRB. In early 2010, a model known as the Expanded 24-Month Study (E24MS) as put into use, replacing the original model. This model explicitly represents many demands in the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB). Demand inputs are generated by various daily and monthly models run in by the LC region. 

The E24MS like the 24MS before it, can only input a single hydrologic trace (though the inflow is available as an ensemble) and therefore its output is not probablistic. The USBR is able to produce a range of possible outputs by running the model with multiple traces representing the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of flow.  This process has been criticized for a number of reasons, one being the considerable effort required to run a single trace, another being that running a 90th percentile trace for example is not a realistic hydologic scenario. 

Also in early 2010, development began on a probabalistic version of the E24MS, know as the Midterm  Operations Model (MOM).  The main feature of this model is built in rules that mimic the operations of each resovoir. This makes it unnecessary to input reservoir outflows.  As a result of the built in operations, an arbitrary number of inflow traces may be run to provide a truely probablisitic look at reservoir conditions over the next 24 months.

\section{Study Area and Data}

\subsection{Study Area}

9 sites in from the UCRB in the MOM. 

\subsection{Constructing a continuous trace}
32 month traces for all for input to the MOM is constructed as a combination of a seasonal forecast model, resampling historical data and a disaggregated hidden Markov (HM) model. A 32 month trace starting on April 1st for a single site is broken down as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Apr - Jul, Year 1:} From a seasonal forcast model similar to \cite{Bracken:2010cw}.  Output is aggregated to the MOM sites and regression analysis if performed to transform the data from natural to unregualted. In addition Morrow Point and Vallecito need special consideration since they are not present in the natural flow record \cite{Prairie:2005tl}. Morrow Point is constructed as a fraction of Crystal inflow. Vallecito is constructed using regression of Navajo Flow against historical natural flow at Los Pi$\tilde{\mbox{n}}$os.

\item {\bf Aug - Dec, Year 1:} KNN resample \citep{Lall:1995wk} a historical sequence based on the closest the seasonal flow volume. 

\item {\bf Jan - Dec, Year 2:} Using the forecasted seasonal flow volume disaggregate \citep{Nowak:2010ha} from an annual HM model forecast.

\item {\bf Jan - Dec, Year 2:} Same as above but use the second step ahead forecast. 

\item {\bf Jan - Dec, Year 2:} Same as above but use the third step ahead forecast and only include the forst three of 12 months. 
\end{enumerate}
