\section{Modeling Operations}
\begin{frame}{Modeling Operations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Actual operations are a combination of many factors:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Law (EIS's)
		\item Guidelines (Power Generation)
		\item Daily Targets
		\item Monthly or Seasonal Targets
		\item Peak Flows
		\item Base Flow
		\item Extreme Events (Dam Safety Operations)
		\item MANY More...
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example}
\begin{frame}{Example}
\framesubtitle{Operator Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Baseflows: steady release mid August to mid April (usually 1000-1200 cfs)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Flows are steady to protect fish (spawning, etc.) and to prevent flooding due to ice jamming
		\item Set flow to put reservoir at March/April 6468ft target
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example}

\textbf{Set December-March Baseflow}

\textit{Execution Constraint}: Month is December

\textit{Description}: Set December-March outflow to steady value that will meet ``April 1 Target Elevation''

\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute change in volume given ``April 1 Target Elevation'' and current elevation
	\item Add volume gain from forecasts December-March (4 months)
	\item Compute max steady flow over December-March (4 months)
\end{itemize}

\section{Implications}
\begin{frame}{Implications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Self-documenting process
\item Testing gets harder as more reservoirs are added
\item Many operations don't translate perfectly to a monthly model

\item Rules must be very robust for different model start dates and hydrologic conditions
\begin{itemize}
\item Lots of checking which month it is!
\end{itemize}
\item ...3,2,1 rule ordering is crucial
\end{itemize}
