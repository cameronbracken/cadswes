## Background
- Research Experience for Undergraduates 
- B.S. Environmental Resources Engineering / Applied Math, Humboldt State University, 2009
- Started work at CADSWES this summer 
- Started CU Boulder Water Resources Program this fall 

## Past work 
- Work in this field started in summer 2007
- Directly related to project now
- Goal was to develop a robust streamflow forecast framework
	- Handle many different spatial locations 
	- Preserve spatial and temporal dependencies
	- Incorporate large scale climate predictors 
	- Use Modern Nonparametric methods
	- Output ensembles

## Framework
1. Create annual timeseries at the index gauge which is an aggregation of all the sites at all the forecast locations
2. Identify large scale climate predictors 
	- Grantz et al. 2005
3. Generate ensemble forecasts 
	- Regonda et al., 2006
4. Nonparametric disag
	- Prairie et al., 2007
	
## Past work - Findings 
Colorado Basin River Forecast Center’s (CBRFC) Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and the National Resource Conservation Service’s, ‘coordinated’ forecast, which is a combination of the ESP, Statistical Water Supply (SWS)

- Figure: Seasonal flows at Lees Ferry
- Results are proof of concept 
- Skill retained after spatial and temporal disag
- Simple robust framework that compares well to existing models 
	
## Probabilistic midterm model 
Previous work is directly related the the broad topic of my current and future work, the pmm.

- Midterm operational forecast model for the CRB
- Plan is to be the next generation of the 24 month study
- A lot of the details are still TBD but many new features are planned
	- Multiple Traces (24 month study gives single trace)
	- Second year forecasts (24 month study uses climatology for second year)
		- This is where past work comes in 
	- Incorporate demands and operational rules
		- Use natural flow as an input
	- Real time data inputs
		- Read rulesets and dmi's and 

## Groundwork for the PMM - 
In order to use natural flow as an input to the PMM we need to understand the differences between the River forecast centers real time flows and Reclamation's natural flow

- plot differences
	- Flows track well but differ in magnitude
- If RCF data was purely unregulated then the difference would match the total consumptive uses and losses
- Some uses are being accounted for 
	
## Next steps 
- Continue to investigate RFC modeling differences 
- Operational rule sets for 
- Intelligent second year forecasts
